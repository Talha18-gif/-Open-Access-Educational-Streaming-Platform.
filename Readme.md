Open Access Educational Streaming Platform

## Project Description
The Open Access Educational Streaming Platform is a decentralized solution for creators to upload and monetize their educational content. Users can access these resources by paying a specified price (in Ether) to the creators. This platform leverages Ethereum's smart contract capabilities to ensure transparency, security, and automation of content access and payments.

Creators can easily upload their educational content, and users can subscribe to the content they wish to access. The platform ensures a fair transaction by automatically transferring payments to content creators when users subscribe to their content.

## Contract Address

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to democratize access to quality educational resources by allowing creators from all over the world to share their knowledge and expertise. By utilizing blockchain technology, we aim to provide a transparent and decentralized platform where creators have full control over their content, and users have secure, frictionless access to educational materials.



## Key Features

### 1. **Creator-Driven Content Management**
   - Content creators can easily upload and manage their educational content, providing a title, URL, and price for access.
   - Creators can deactivate (remove) their content if desired, ensuring they retain control over their work.

### 2. **Secure Payment System**
   - Users can subscribe to content by paying the specified price directly to the creator, using Ether (ETH).
   - The contract ensures that creators receive payments automatically once the transaction is completed.

### 3. **Subscription System**
   - Users can subscribe to content by paying the content's price in Ether.
   - The contract tracks user subscriptions to verify content access and ensure only subscribers can view the content.

### 4. **Content Deactivation**
   - Creators can deactivate (remove) content, making it unavailable to new subscribers while keeping it accessible to existing subscribers.
   
### 5. **Transparency and Automation**
   - The platform runs on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring that all transactions (such as content access and payments) are secure, transparent, and automated without intermediaries.
   - Smart contract logic automates the process, ensuring that creators are compensated fairly and users can access content with minimal friction.

### 6. **Decentralized Platform**
   - No centralized entity controls content or payments, ensuring that both creators and users have autonomy.
   - All content details, including price and availability, are stored on-chain, ensuring trust in the system.

### 7. **Owner Privileges**
   - The contract owner has special administrative privileges such as withdrawing contract funds but does not interfere with day-to-day operations.


## Future Enhancements

- **Refunds**: Implement functionality for users to request refunds in case of errors or deactivated content.
- **Content Rating and Review**: Add a system for users to rate and review content.
- **Subscription Plans**: Introduce tiered subscriptions, allowing users to subscribe to multiple content pieces at a discounted rate.
- **Access Control**: Introduce role-based permissions for advanced content moderation and platform management.
- **Mobile App**: Build a mobile app for easier access to the platform and interactions with the smart contract.
